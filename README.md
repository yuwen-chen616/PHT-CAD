# PHT-CAD: Efficient CAD Parametric Primitive Analysis with Progressive Hierarchical Tuning

![Overview of PHT-CAD framework](images/phtcad_framework.png)

## Introduction

We propose PHT-CAD, a novel 2D PPA framework that harnesses the modality alignment and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for precise engineering drawing analysis. In PHT-CAD, we introduce four dedicated regression heads to predict corresponding atomic components. To train PHT-CAD, a three-stage training paradigm Progressive Hierarchical Tuning (PHT) is proposed to progressively enhance PHT-CAD's capability to perceive individual primitives, infer structural constraints, and align annotation layers with their corresponding geometric representations. Considering that existing datasets lack complete annotation layers and real-world engineering drawings, we introduce ParaCAD, the first large-scale benchmark that explicitly integrates both the geometric and annotation layers. ParaCAD comprises over 10 million annotated drawings for training and 3,000 real-world industrial drawings with complex topological structures and physical constraints for test. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PHT-CAD and highlight the practical significance of ParaCAD in advancing 2D PPA research.

## ParaCAD benchmark

![Some samples of ParaCAD](images/phtcadsample.png)

We present ParaCAD, the first large-scale 2D PPA benchmark that incorporates the annotation layer. ParaCAD includes 10.26 million annotated engineering drawings for training and 3,000 real-world industrial drawings for test. The samples for test exhibit higher topological complexity and adhere to physical constraints.
